What is a Supplier?
A supplier is any entity (business, manufacturer, or individual) that provides goods/services to retailers, distributors, or end-users. They’re the first link in the supply chain, bridging manufacturers and sellers.

Key Roles of Suppliers:  
✔ Source raw materials or finished products  
✔ Ensure quality control  
✔ Manage bulk inventory and logistics  

# 4 Types of Suppliers
## Manufacturers 
Produce goods from raw materials (ideal for bulk orders).

Often require higher MOQs but offer the best pricing.

## Distributors (Wholesalers) 
Buy in bulk from manufacturers and resell in smaller quantities.

Perfect for businesses needing flexible order sizes.

## Independent Craftspeople 
Handmade or niche product specialists.

Best for unique, low-volume orders.

## Importers 
Source internationally unavailable products.

Simplify cross-border trade compliance.

Supplier vs. Vendor: What’s the Difference?
Supplier	Vendor
Provides raw materials/components	Sells finished goods directly to customers
Works with manufacturers/retailers	Sells to end-users (e.g., e-commerce stores)
Example: If you run a clothing brand, your supplier provides fabrics, while your vendor is the online store selling your shirts.
