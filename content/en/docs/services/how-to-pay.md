## 1. Common Payment Risks When Importing from China

### 🔹 Supplier Scams (Disappearing After Payment)
- Some suppliers take your money and vanish.
- Others ship defective or wrong products.

### 🔹 Requests for Suspicious Payment Methods
- **Paying to a personal account** (not a company account) → No legal protection.
- **Offshore accounts** (e.g., Hong Kong, Singapore for Chinese suppliers) → Could mean tax evasion or fraud.
- **WeChat Pay / Alipay** → No buyer protection, hard to recover funds.

### 🔹 Quality & Compliance Issues
- You pay upfront, but the goods fail inspections.
- Supplier refuses refunds or rework.

### 🔹 Payment Disputes & Chargeback Problems
- **Wire transfers (TT) are irreversible**—once sent, money is gone.
- **PayPal disputes** may favor Chinese suppliers if they provide fake tracking.

### 🔹 Shipping & Customs Scams
- Supplier delays shipment or sends wrong HS codes, causing customs seizures.

## 3. What If a Supplier Asks for Shady Payment Methods?

### 🚩 Red Flags:
- **"Pay to my personal account"** → Could be a scammer.
- **"We only accept WeChat Pay/Alipay"** → No fraud protection.
- **"Our company account is under maintenance, use this offshore account"** → Likely avoiding taxes or hiding fraud.

### 🛡️ What to Do?
1. **Insist on a company bank account** (check business license matches).
2. **Use Escrow or Alibaba Trade Assurance** (payment held until delivery).
3. **Avoid WeChat/Alipay** unless it's a tiny order you can afford to lose.
4. **Check supplier background** (factory audit, video call, past client reviews).
5. **Start with a small test order** before large payments.
