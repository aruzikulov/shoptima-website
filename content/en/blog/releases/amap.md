# How to Use Amap in English for Navigation in China: A Guide for Foreigners

Traveling in China can be an exciting adventure, but navigating its bustling cities and rural areas can be challenging for foreigners, especially with language barriers and the unavailability of Google Maps. Amap (also known as Gaode Map or 高德地图), one of China’s leading navigation apps, is a powerful tool to help you get around. With its English-language support introduced in January 2025, Amap has become a game-changer for international travelers. This guide will walk you through how to download, set up, and use Amap in English to navigate China like a local.

## Why Choose Amap?

Amap is China’s most popular navigation app, trusted by over 1 billion users for its accurate, real-time navigation and comprehensive features. Here’s why it’s ideal for foreigners:
- **English Support**: Amap now offers an English interface, making it accessible for non-Chinese speakers.[](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202501/23/WS679200b3a310a2ab06ea8f0c.html)[](https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/01/23/amap-unveils-chinas-first-english-map-a-game-changer-for-foreign-tourists/)
- **Unmatched Accuracy**: With National Class-A Navigation and Surveying Certification, Amap provides centimeter-level precision, especially in rural areas and smaller cities.[](https://www.trip.com/guide/phone/gaode-map.html)
- **Multi-Mode Navigation**: Whether you’re walking, driving, cycling, or using public transit, Amap tailors routes with real-time traffic updates.[](https://www.trip.com/guide/phone/gaode-map.html)
- **Integrated Services**: Book rides, find restaurants, or locate attractions—all within the app, thanks to its integration with Alibaba’s ecosystem.[](https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/01/23/amap-unveils-chinas-first-english-map-a-game-changer-for-foreign-tourists/)

Unlike Google Maps, which is unreliable in China due to outdated data and VPN requirements, Amap is designed specifically for China’s roads and services.[](https://thehelpfulpanda.com/best-map-app-for-china/)

## Step-by-Step Guide to Using Amap in English

### 1. Download Amap
- **Where to Find It**: Search for “Amap” or “Gaode Maps” in the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android). It’s listed as “Amap – Gaode Maps” or “高德地图”.[](https://shanghaispecials.com/transportation/switch-gaode-map-amap-from-chinese-to-english/)
- **Pro Tip**: Download the app before arriving in China to avoid connectivity issues. If you’re already in China and can’t access Google Play, try Huawei AppGallery or Xiaomi Store.[](https://sg.trip.com/guide/phone/amap.html)
- **Note**: As of April 2025, the English version is in beta and primarily available for overseas users in China. Ensure you have the latest app version (15.09.0.2022 or higher).[](https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/01/23/amap-unveils-chinas-first-english-map-a-game-changer-for-foreign-tourists/)

### 2. Set Up the App
- **No Account Needed**: You can use Amap in guest mode without a Chinese phone number, which is perfect for tourists.[](https://sg.trip.com/guide/phone/amap.html)
- **Change Language to English**:
  1. Open the Amap app.
  2. Tap the “Me” (我的) tab at the bottom right.
  3. Go to Settings (设置), usually indicated by a gear icon.
  4. Find “Language” (语言) and select “English”.
  5. Restart the app to apply changes.[](https://shanghaispecials.com/transportation/switch-gaode-map-amap-from-chinese-to-english/)
- **Important**: The English option may be grayed out on some devices, as the feature is still being rolled out. If this happens, ensure your phone’s system language is set to English, or check for app updates. Voice navigation will be in English if your phone’s language is set to English.[](https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/01/23/amap-unveils-chinas-first-english-map-a-game-changer-for-foreign-tourists/)[](https://shanghaispecials.com/transportation/switch-gaode-map-amap-from-chinese-to-english/)

### 3. Navigating with Amap
- **Search for Destinations**:
  - Enter your destination in English (e.g., “Forbidden City” or “Hongqiao Airport”) or Pinyin (e.g., “Wangfujing” for 王府井) in the search bar (搜索).[](https://www.trip.com/guide/phone/gaode-map.html)[](https://www.trip.com/guide/phone/baidu-map-app.html)
  - Place names may appear in Pinyin or Chinese characters, but major attractions often have English descriptions.[](https://shanghaispecials.com/transportation/switch-gaode-map-amap-from-chinese-to-english/)
  - Save frequent locations by tapping the star (★) to add them to Favorites (收藏夹). Rename them in English for convenience: long-press the name, tap “Rename” (重命名), and type.[](https://www.trip.com/guide/phone/baidu-map-app.html)
- **Choose Your Transport Mode**:
  - Tap “Route” (路线) and select your mode: walking, public transit, driving, or cycling.[](https://www.trip.com/guide/phone/baidu-map-app.html)
  - For public transit, Amap provides detailed subway and bus routes, including metro exit numbers and real-time bus locations.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1c84blk/map_apps_in_china/)
  - Walking mode includes unique features like traffic light countdowns and shaded routes in hot weather.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1c84blk/map_apps_in_china/)
- **Follow Directions**:
  - Amap offers turn-by-turn navigation with color-coded routes (green for smooth traffic).[](https://english.shanghai.gov.cn/en-UsefulApps/20241213/59a549d4bdf1440c8e86251d5ac7d5a9.html)
  - Use offline maps for areas with poor internet. Download city or province map packs in advance via Settings.[](https://sinostep.com/china-map-app/)
- **Pro Tip**: Always have the Chinese address of your destination (e.g., from your hotel) to show taxi drivers or input into Amap, as English names may not always match local listings.[](https://thehelpfulpanda.com/best-map-app-for-china/)

### 4. Booking Rides
- **Ride-Hailing**: Amap integrates taxi and ride-hailing services. Enter your destination, select a car type, and view nearby drivers with estimated wait times.[](https://sg.trip.com/guide/phone/amap.html)
- **Payment**: Most rides require Alipay or WeChat Pay. Set up one of these before traveling, as cash is rarely accepted. Amap shows price estimates upfront.[](https://sg.trip.com/guide/phone/amap.html)
- **Tip**: Use the in-app chat with auto-translate to communicate with drivers, especially for precise pickup locations.[](https://www.klook.com/blog/useful-apps-china/)

### 5. Additional Features
- **Real-Time Traffic**: Amap’s traffic data helps you avoid congestion, saving 10–20 minutes in cities like Beijing or Shanghai.[](https://www.trip.com/guide/phone/gaode-map.html)
- **Local Services**: Find restaurants, hotels, and attractions with English descriptions. Book services via integrations with Alipay, Fliggy, or Ele.me.[](https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/01/23/amap-unveils-chinas-first-english-map-a-game-changer-for-foreign-tourists/)
- **Speed Camera Alerts**: Useful for drivers, along with estimated tolls and multi-stop route planning.[](https://sg.trip.com/guide/phone/amap.html)
- **Privacy**: Amap complies with China’s cybersecurity laws and encrypts user data. Disable unnecessary permissions (e.g., microphone) for added security.[](https://www.trip.com/guide/phone/gaode-map.html)

## Tips for Success
- **Prepare in Advance**: Download Amap and offline maps before your trip. Familiarize yourself with the interface to save time.[](https://thehelpfulpanda.com/best-map-app-for-china/)
- **Use a VPN Sparingly**: Turn off your VPN when using Amap, as it can interfere with GPS accuracy.[](https://www.trip.com/guide/phone/baidu-map-app.html)
- **Translation Apps**: Pair Amap with apps like Pleco or Google Translate to screenshot and translate Chinese text in the app.[](https://www.trip.com/guide/phone/china-map-app.html)
- **China eSIM**: Stay connected with a China eSIM for real-time navigation and ride-hailing.[](https://sg.trip.com/guide/phone/amap.html)
- **Check for Updates**: The English version is still evolving. Check the App Store or Google Play for the latest version to ensure full functionality.[](https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/01/23/amap-unveils-chinas-first-english-map-a-game-changer-for-foreign-tourists/)

## Limitations
- **Beta Phase**: The English interface is not fully functional on all devices, and some menus may remain in Chinese.[](https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/01/23/amap-unveils-chinas-first-english-map-a-game-changer-for-foreign-tourists/)
- **Pinyin Confusion**: Place names may use Pinyin or unofficial translations (e.g., “South Luogu Lane” vs. “Nanluoguxiang”). Cross-check with travel guides or TripAdvisor.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinalife/comments/1i73vup/gaode_maps_aka_amap_is_bringing_english_back_to/)
- **Ads**: You may encounter ads when opening the app, but they can be closed quickly.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinalife/comments/1i73vup/gaode_maps_aka_amap_is_bringing_english_back_to/)

## Alternative Apps
If Amap’s English version isn’t working for you, consider:
- **Apple Maps**: Decent for iPhone users in big cities, as it uses Gaode data, but lacks detailed features like subway exit info.[](https://www.trip.com/guide/phone/china-map-app.html)
- **MetroMan**: Great for public transit navigation, but limited to transportation.[](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294211-i642-k14762206-Urgent_Help_Me_With_Map_App_in_China-China.html)
- **LingoMap**: A bilingual overlay for Amap, though no longer updated and only available on older devices.[](https://thehelpfulpanda.com/best-map-app-for-china/)
- **Baidu Maps**: Similar to Amap but with fewer English options and more ads.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinalife/comments/1i73vup/gaode_maps_aka_amap_is_bringing_english_back_to/)
