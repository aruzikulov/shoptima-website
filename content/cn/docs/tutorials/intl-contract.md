# 🌍 International Contracts with Chinese Suppliers: Key Protections for Global Buyers  

When dealing directly with Chinese suppliers, international contracts bridge legal systems and cultural gaps. Here's what you need to know:  

---

## 📜 **Critical Clauses for Cross-Border Contracts**  

### 1. **Jurisdiction & Law**  
- **Recommended**:  

  "This agreement shall be governed by United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) and disputes resolved via CIETAC arbitration in Beijing."  

  Avoid: Letting suppliers dictate local Chinese courts

2. Payment Security
Structure:

30% deposit via SWIFT/TT

70% balance after passed inspection

Never Include: "Final payment upon production completion" (loses leverage)

3. Quality Standards
Must Specify:
✅ AQL 2.5 (defect allowance)
✅ Third-party inspection rights
✅ Sample approval process

4. IP Protection
Essential Addendum:
"All molds/tooling remain buyer's property regardless of payment status."

5. Force Majeure
Redline: Remove vague terms like "government policies" - specify exact scenarios (e.g., WHO-declared pandemics).

🚩 Red Flags in International Contracts
Risk	Solution
"Chinese law only" clause	Demand CISG + CIETAC
RMB-denominated payments	Insist on USD/EUR
Vague delivery terms	Specify Incoterms 2020
No mold ownership clause	Add tooling appendix
Case Study: German buyer recovered $120k in mold costs using IP clauses after supplier bankruptcy.
