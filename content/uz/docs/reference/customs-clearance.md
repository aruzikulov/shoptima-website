## 🔍 How We Handle China Customs Clearance  

At **SHOPTIMA**, we streamline the entire process—from China export clearance to preparing your country’s import documents—ensuring your shipments arrive smoothly and compliantly. 

### 1. **Expert China Export Documentation**  
We prepare and submit all required Chinese export paperwork, including:  
- **Commercial Invoice** (with accurate HS codes, values, and Incoterms)  
- **Packing List** (verified weights/dimensions to avoid discrepancies)  
- **China Export Declarations** (electronically filed for efficiency)  
- **Fumigation/Certificates of Origin** (if required for your goods)  

### 2. **HS Code Classification**  
- Our logistics team assigns the correct **Harmonized System (HS) codes** to avoid customs delays or misclassification penalties.  

### 3. **Pre-Clearance Checks**  
- We verify all documents against China’s latest export regulations (e.g., SAFE, AQSIQ, or CCC compliance) to prevent last-minute holds.

## 🌍 Preparing Your Country’s Import Documents  

### 1. **Country-Specific Customization**  
We tailor documentation to meet your destination’s requirements, such as:  
- **FDA/SAA/CE certifications** (for regulated products)  
- **Import Permits/Licenses** (pre-filled templates for your review)  
- **Duty Optimization** (advising on tariff classifications to reduce costs)  

### 2. **Key Documents We Provide**  
- **Bill of Lading (B/L) or Air Waybill (AWB)**  
- **Customs Declaration Forms** (pre-completed for your broker)  
- **Insurance Certificates** (if arranged under CIF terms)  

### 3. **Pre-Shipment Review**  
- Share drafts of all documents for your approval before shipping.

## 💡 Why SHOPTIMA Stands Out  
✅ **Reduced Clearance Time**: Accurate paperwork = fewer customs inspections.  
✅ **Avoid Costly Errors**: No mismatched invoices or missing certificates.  
✅ **End-to-End Support**: From China factory to your warehouse.  

📌 **Example**: A client importing machinery to Germany saved **2 weeks** in clearance after we provided pre-approved TÜV certifications and EU conformity declarations.
